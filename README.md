# SyntheticImageDetection
For this project we downloaded the ArtiFact data set from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/artifact-dataset

The data was downloaded to the main folder and was renamed AritFact.

We ran each of the model files in VScode. We also had a RTX 4080 GPU and an A5000 to handle much of the computational power. 

Team Contributions:
Isaac Lau - Researched existing solutions and surrounding literature. Implemented code from other participants in the competition and ran it as a baseline. Wrote introduction, related works, and dataset portion of the paper.

Jose Morales - Wrote some of the for the models and ran the DenseNet, InceptionNet, and Vision Transformer models, wrote the proposed approach and part of the experiments sections.

Neena Xiang - Wrote some code for the models and ran all ResNet models, wrote the results, discussion, and conclusion of the paper
